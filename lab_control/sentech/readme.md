# Controller for Omron Sentech cameras
Tested with STC-MBS500U3V

This is a thin wrapper of *Harvester*
Only very limited features are implemented.

## Preparation

- Install the SDK  
https://industrial.omron.eu/en/products/STC-MBS500U3V#software

- Find the *cti* file **libstgentl.cti**  
In Ubuntu with the default installer, it should be `/opt/sentech/lib/libstgentl.cti`

- Install Harvester  
`git clone https://github.com/genicam/harvesters.git`
